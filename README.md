# Python_code

Pattern code generator for emotion display for the robot. 

The application gives a GUI for users to test emotions and patterns. The user needs to create the virtual pattern on the application. The application then converts the selected pattern into input coordinate codes that when fed into the processor, produces the pattern on the LED matrix.

Different emotions can be tested and deployed using this program.
